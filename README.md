Project Background

A client has launched a pop-up café in a busy business district and are offering home-made lunches and refreshments to the surrounding offices. They require a software application that can help them log and track orders. 

Client Requirements:

-	Maintain a collection of products and couriers
-	New orders created on the system when customer makes a new order
-	Update the status of an order (i.e., preparing, out for delivery, delivered etc.)
-	Persist all data when application exited (not lost)
-	Load all persisted data when app starts
-	Make sure the application is tested and proven to work well
-	Receive regular software updates

How did you meet the client brief?

I was able to meet the client brief in the following ways:
-	Create a collection products and couriers using a database table
-	Create an order and add the order to a dictionary 
-	View the products and couriers directly from the database table
-	Update and delete a product (shopping cart) and courier
-	View all previous orders, even when an application has been exited or started
-	Update customer order details
-	Update the order status 
-	Persist the order to a CSV File to keep track of orders
-	Use unit testing (Patching) to prove application works

How did you guarantee the client requirements? 

I was able to guarantee the client requirements using unit testing, specially using Patching. I was able to test the functions to see if they executed correctly. I was also able to implement try and except, which stopped any errors from occurring such as wrong button being clicked.

If you had more time, what is one thing you would improve upon? 

-	Make application “look nice”
-	Add prices the products and have contact numbers for the couriers
-	Persist all my orders to the database table as opposed to the CSV File 
-	Import the functions to the test files instead of re-writing the function on the test file
-	Track product inventory
-	Display orders by order status or couriers
-	CRUD a list of customers 
-	Update or delete previous orders
-	Use indexing and IDs

More time to implement the above improvements as well as more practise using python. Also using a different source coder editor, instead of VS Code, as there were on going issues with testing which means I could not implement my original version of testing the application. 

What did you most enjoy implementing?

Being able to use export my order to a CSV File and being able to look at those orders later, even if the application is exited or restarted. Also being able to pull products and couriers from a database.
